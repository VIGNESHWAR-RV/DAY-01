 PARADIGM - "way of programming"
 
 Most languages nowadays, support multiple ways to approach the solution to the task (or) problem.
 so these languages can be termed as MULTI-PARADIGM LANGUAGES.
 
 IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING :
  
     If the approach to the solution is defined step by step , then the way is considered as IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING.
	 
	 
 DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING :
 
     If the approach to solution defines what you want to get and not the procedures involved in the approach , 
	    then it is considered as DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING.
		
		
 STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING :
 
     If the approach to solution consist of nested loops in a structural way , then it is considered as STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING. 
	 
	 
 FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING :
 
     If the approach to solution consist of calling funtions to perform operations ,then it called FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING.
	 
	 
 LOGICAL PROGRAMMING :

     If the approach to the solution consist of the logical conditions (or) facts to perform operations , then it is known as
          LOGICAL PROGRAMMING.


 OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING :
 
     If the approach to the solution consist of creating and using objects to perform operations ,then its known as 
         OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING>
