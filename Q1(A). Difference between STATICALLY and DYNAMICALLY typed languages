                        DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATICALLY-TYPED AND DYNAMICALLY-TYPED LANGUAGES


     STATICALLY TYPED LANGUAGES                                          DYNAMICALLY-TYPED LANGUAGES
						
1. Type of the data used in the code is                            Type of the data used in the code is 
     already declared and it is checked                                     determined during  
      during compiling time.                                                    run-time.
									  
									  
2. Useful when the datatype is already                             Useful when the datatype is unknown.

3. Runs fast as there is no type check                             Takes time to run comparitively as it
     process involved in runtime.                                        performs type-check during

4. Throws error during compiling time                              Throws an error or respective datatype
