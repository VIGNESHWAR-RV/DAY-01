1. The client and server communicates                          The client and server communicates after

2. It makes multiple TCP connection                            The binary framing layer encodes request/response
      to avoid HEAD-OF-LINE blocking                            and cuts it into smaller packets called streams
     (blocks all headers in queue                                  which would greatly reduce the HOL blocking 
   if a header cannot retrieve the data)	                          with use of single TCP connection.

3.To avoid buffer overflow , receiver                          Instead of relying on transfer layer (ACK packet)
    sends the recieve window to sender                          the client and server set their own flow controls

5.It uses (gzip) to compress the resources                     It uses (HPACK) which has the ability to compress the
