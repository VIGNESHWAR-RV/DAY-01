Actually the difference between the programming language and the scripting language 
 depends on the environment on which he language is writing its codes.

If a language is written over an existing appplication in order to perform necessary operations
 in the application , then the codes written are called "SCRIPTS" and the language is
considered as SCRIPTING LANGUAGE. Most of the scripting languages are not compiled into 
bytecode and interpreted on the run( interpreted in run-time ) as they are often used over 
an existing applications. Ex : javascript.

If a language is wriiten over the platform(ie operating system && cpu) , then its considered 
 as PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.The application that directly work on the operating system are developed 
the programming languages. These langauages are compiled into bytecode which can be easily executed on 
 the platforms supporting the languages.Ex : c++,Java,etc... The only disadvantage of those langauages is
that they predefine the datatypes that can be used in the code else they wont be compiled into bytecode.
They cant run with dynamic datatypes and thats where scripting languages plays a major role.
