       OBJECT AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS 
	            IN JAVASCRIPT
				
1. OBJECT is reference datatype which is defined by the user.

2. OBJECT always have data interms of KEY-VALUE pairs.

3.The key value pairs are enclosed within the two curly braces.

4.The value to the key(PROPERTY) is assigned using semicolon(:).

5.The typical object in javascript is represented as 
       
	   let object = {
	        key1 : 'value1',
			key2 : 'value2'
			};
			
6.The key-values can be added to object from outside the object either by using DOT/BRACKET NOTATIONS.
        object.key3 = 'value3';
        object['key4'] = 'value4';
		
7.The key-value pair of the object can be removed from object using DELETE keyword.
        delete object.key4;
		
8.To print the its specific property(key) , we should use either dot / bracket notation.
         console.log(object.key2);

9.If we want to update an existing property(key) , we should declare the property name with required value (re-assigning)
         object.key1 = 'value1';

10.In object, many properties (keys) can have same value but same property(key)	cannot have many values.
    In such cases , only the last assigned value will be the value of the object.


      Ex :  let pocoF1 = {
                Brand : [{MainBrand : 'MI' , SubBrand : 'POCO' }],
                year : 2018,
                Variant : '6GB/128GB',
                color : 'blue',
               	Price : '$249'
                };				
				
            console.log(pocoF1.color);
			
            output :  'blue'
